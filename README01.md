Lab Exercise: Working with ENV Variables
üéØ Objectives
This lab exercise focuses on:

Understanding the importance of Environment (ENV) variables.
Learning to use the dotenv package for managing these variables.
Implementing a script that securely retrieves and utilizes ENV variables.
üìö Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:

Basic knowledge of JavaScript.
Familiarity with terminal/command line operations.
üöÄ Steps
1. Install the dotenv Package
Install the dotenv package using npm to help load ENV variables from a .env file into your application.

Run the following command:

npm install dotenv
2. Create an .env File
Create a file named .env in your project directory and add the following variables:

API_KEY=
SERVER_SECRET=
IS_KALVIAN=true
Fill in the values for API_KEY and SERVER_SECRET as needed.

3. Read the ENV Variables
Write a JavaScript script to retrieve and use these variables with the dotenv package.

Here‚Äôs an example:

// Load the dotenv package
require('dotenv').config();

// Access environment variables
capiKey: process.env.API_KEY,
  serverSecret: process.env.SERVER_SECRET,
  isKalvian: process.env.IS_KALVIAN === 'true',
};

// Export the config object
module.exports = config;

// Log the variables (Optional for testing)
console.log(config);
onst config = {
4. Run the Script

Execute the script to verify that the environment variables are loaded and accessible.

node <your_script_name>.js
You should see the environment variables printed in the console if everything is set up correctly.

üèÅ Outcome
By completing this exercise, you will have:

Created a script that securely retrieves and uses ENV variables.
Learned the importance of dotenv in managing environment configurations.
Enhanced the security and flexibility of your code by separating sensitive data from your source files.
üéâ Congratulations! You've successfully implemented a secure environment variable management system using the dotenv package.
